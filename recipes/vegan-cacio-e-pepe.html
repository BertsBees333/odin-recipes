        <h3>Time:</h3>
        <p><strong>Prep:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook:</strong> 15 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Additional:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Total:</strong> 35 minutes</p>
        <p>(Serves Two)</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup raw cashews</li>
            <li>1 (8oz.) package of spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tsp miso paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>3 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp EVOO</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak cashews in boiling water. Set aside for minimum 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender, roughly 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>While pasta is boiling, drain cashews and blend until creamy. Add nutritional yeast, miso, and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper to the cashew cream. Slowly add pasta water to thin it out as needed.</li>
            <li>Drain spaghetti, saving 1 cup of pasta water. Mix spaghetti and cashew cream sauce together, adding reserved pasta water if needed. The consistency should be thick enough that the sauce will stick to the pasta.</li>
            <li>Plata and top each serving with EVOO and remaining 1/4 tsp black pepper. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
